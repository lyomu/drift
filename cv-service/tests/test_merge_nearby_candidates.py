    A cluster must not grow wider than min_gap, even when consecutive members are close.

    This test previously asserted the opposite, that 100, 108 and 116 collapse to a single
    event at 108, on the reasoning that each consecutive pair is within min_gap. Chaining
    was deliberate and it was wrong: 100 and 116 are 16 frames apart, which at 30fps is
    0.53s, comfortably long enough to hold two separate contacts. In a dense rally the
    chain runs much further than three candidates and deletes real events.

    Measured across 12 dataset clips and 91 labelled contacts, bounding the cluster moved
    event recall from 51.6% to 68.1% with precision unchanged at ~94%, because everything
    it stopped destroying was real. See eval/event_recall_funnel.py.
