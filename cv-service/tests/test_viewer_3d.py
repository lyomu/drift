Tests for utils/viewer_3d.py.

The viewer is a generated artifact, so these check the things that silently break it:
malformed embedded JSON, a missing video reference, coordinates that are not in court
metres, and - most importantly - that an uncalibrated run is not presented as if it
were measured.
