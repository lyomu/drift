## external/tracknet_original/

Original TrackNet tennis dataset (Huang et al. 2019, arXiv:1907.03698). Pulled because
this project needed ball positions labelled by someone other than us: every event-detection
number in the README is measured against these coordinates rather than against our own
annotations, which is what makes them checkable by a third party.

- **Source:** https://github.com/yastrebksv/TrackNet (unofficial reimplementation repo,
  links to the original Google Drive dataset release)
- **Contents:** 10 broadcast games, **95 clips**, 19,835 labeled frames, 1280×720 @ 30fps.
  Each clip has a `Label.csv`: `file name, visibility, x-coordinate, y-coordinate, status`.
- **Bonus:** `ctb_regr_bounce.cbm` - a pretrained CatBoost bounce-regression model that
  came in the same drive folder.
- **Same lineage as our model:** `model_best.pt` here has the identical Google Drive file
  ID already referenced in `trackers/tracknet_ball_tracker.py`'s docstring - this is the
  training data behind the TrackNet weights we already run, not a new foreign source.
- **License:** not explicitly stated by the original authors; released for research
  reproduction. Treat as research-use-only.

### Label encoding - confirmed against the paper text (arXiv:1907.03698, Section III),
### cross-checked against `yastrebksv/TrackNet/bounce_train.py:34`. Not inferred.

**`status`** ("Trajectory Pattern"):
| value | meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | flying - normal in-flight motion, no event |
| `1` | **hit** - player contact |
| `2` | **bounce** - ball touches the court |
| *(blank)* | undocumented - do not assume a meaning; observed near some clip boundaries |

**`visibility`** ("Visibility Class"):
| value | meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | ball not in frame |
| `1` | clearly visible |
| `2` | in frame but not easily identifiable (blends with background etc.) |
| `3` | occluded by another object (e.g. a player) |

## labels/

Our own labels, produced with `tools/label_shots.py`, which also documents the schema
and the labelling conventions. See `tools/LABELLING_GUIDE.md` for how a shot type or an
ambiguous event should be called.
