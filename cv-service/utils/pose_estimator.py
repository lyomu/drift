───────────────────────
Thin wrapper over MediaPipe Tasks PoseLandmarker, scoped to what shot classification
needs: upper-body landmarks for a single known player, in original-frame pixel space.

Why crop-then-detect
--------------------
A broadcast tennis frame contains ball kids, line judges, and a full crowd. Running pose
on the whole frame would find dozens of people and leave us guessing which is the player.
We already know exactly where each player is (their tracked bbox), so we crop to that box
and detect one pose inside it. Fewer false positives, much less compute.

Why only on contact frames
--------------------------
The label we want is per-shot, not per-frame. Running pose on all 570 frames is wasted
work - the caller passes only the frames where a shot was detected.

API note: mediapipe 1.0.0 removed the legacy `mp.solutions.pose` interface. This uses the
current Tasks API (`mediapipe.tasks.python.vision.PoseLandmarker`), which requires a
downloaded `.task` model bundle:
  curl -L -o models/pose_landmarker_lite.task \\

                            regressing any frame that already worked at 0.15; 0.60 pulled
                            in enough background/other-player noise to break one of those.

        Detect a pose inside `bbox` and return upper-body landmarks as

        Why z matters here
        ------------------
        A tennis player turns side-on to hit, which collapses the shoulder axis in image
        space - measured as low as 2.8px wide on this clip's groundstrokes, where a
        2-3px landmark error flips the left/right sign outright. MediaPipe's z (depth
        relative to the hip midpoint) grows exactly when image-x shrinks: on a side-on
        frame here, shoulder dx was 0.037 while dz was 0.607. Carrying z lets the shot
        classifier build the body axis in the horizontal (x, z) plane, which stays
        well-conditioned at every body orientation.

        z is reported by MediaPipe on roughly the same scale as *normalised* x, so it is
        multiplied by the crop width to put all three components in comparable pixel
        units.

        Returns None when the model is unavailable, the crop is degenerate, no pose is
        found, or every landmark falls below `min_visibility`. Returning None is
        deliberate: an absent label is more useful downstream than a fabricated one.
