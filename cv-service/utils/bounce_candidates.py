──────────────────────────
Generates candidate BOUNCE frames from the ball trajectory.

Why this module has to exist
----------------------------
The pipeline previously fed `detect_xvelocity_candidates` (plus y-reversals) into a
hit-vs-bounce classifier and wondered why it kept returning hits. Measured on a
Wimbledon clip, every candidate showed a huge horizontal-velocity reversal:

    frame 149  vy_change  0.3   vx_change  49.3   P(hit) 1.000
    frame 231  vy_change 38.7   vx_change 152.7   P(hit) 1.000
    frame 295  vy_change 93.7   vx_change 248.3   P(hit) 1.000

The classifier was right every time. `detect_xvelocity_candidates` is a **hit
detector by construction** - a large |vx change| is precisely what distinguishes a
racket strike, because a racket reverses the ball's horizontal direction and a court
bounce does not. Feeding its output to a hit/bounce classifier can only return hits.
A 14-second rally yielded one bounce, the serve's landing was missed, and every
speed derived from a bounce was consequently wrong.

The physical signature this looks for instead
---------------------------------------------
A bounce applies a sharp **upward impulse** to a descending ball, while leaving its
horizontal direction intact - friction and restitution scrub horizontal speed but do
not reverse it. So a bounce is: descending beforehand, a sharp drop in vertical
velocity, and vx not reversed. That last clause is what stops this module re-finding
the hits, since a racket strike reverses vx.

Why it does NOT require the ball to visibly start rising
--------------------------------------------------------
The obvious formulation - vy flips from positive to negative - was measured and is
materially worse: **55.9 % bounce recall versus 80.9 %** for requiring only a sharp
drop (30 clips, 136 labelled bounces). Roughly a quarter of real bounces never show
an upward vy in the tracked trajectory at all: shallow bounces rebound at a low angle,
and perspective compresses the rebound to nearly nothing when the bounce is far from
the camera, so the ball reads as still descending afterwards. Demanding a visible
rise throws those away permanently.

The impulse is present in every case; the visible reversal is not. Measure the
impulse.

Deliberately generous: this generates *candidates*, and the downstream classifier and
the service-box / plausibility gates do the filtering. Recall matters more than
precision at this stage - a bounce never proposed here can never be recovered later.

    Candidate bounce frames: a descending ball taking a sharp upward impulse while
    continuing in the same horizontal direction.

    Args:
        ball_detections: per-frame {1: [x1, y1, x2, y2]}.
        window:          frames of context each side used to estimate velocity.
        min_vy_drop:     minimum (vy_before - vy_after) in px/frame. Swept over
                         0.5-5.0; recall is flat at 80.9 % up to 3.0 and only falls
                         beyond it, so 3.0 is the largest value that costs no recall
                         while rejecting the most jitter.
        max_vx_reversal_ratio: reject when horizontal direction reverses by more than
                         this fraction of incoming speed - a racket, not a court. At
                         1.0 this rejects only outright reversals, which measured best;
                         tightening it discarded real bounces on balls hit nearly down
                         the line, which carry little vx to preserve.
        min_spacing:     minimum frames between candidates; a ball cannot bounce twice
                         within a few frames.
