─────────────────────
Tests shots against physical evidence, and reports the evidence alongside the verdict.

What this actually turns out to be
-----------------------------------
It was built as a classifier: replace position-guessed Volley and Smash labels with
physically evidenced ones. Measured across the 9 evaluation clips, 81 shots
(eval/physics_evidence_rate.py), it is not behaving like one:

    positively evidenced       1 shot   (1.2%)
    downgraded for lack of
      evidence                20 shots  (24.7%)

A 20-to-1 rejection-to-evidence ratio. On real broadcast rallies almost nothing is a
volley or a smash, so the honest description is a VALIDATION FILTER: its job is
rejecting labels nothing supports, and it does that on a quarter of all shots.

That is worth keeping and worth naming correctly. A quarter of shots would otherwise
carry a confident Volley or Smash label with no evidence behind it, which is the exact
failure this project exists to prevent. The rejection logic must not be weakened on the
grounds that it "rarely fires positively" - rarely firing positively is the correct
behaviour when the shots are rare.

Note the contrast with serve detection, which is genuine positive physical evidence and
does fire: 14 serves evidenced across the same 81 shots. The difference is not that
physics works for one and not the other, it is that serves are common and smashes are
not.

Why this exists
---------------
`ShotClassifier` decides Volley and Smash from court position alone: a player near the
net is volleying, a ball high in the mini-court is a smash. Both are guesses dressed as
measurements - they have never had ground truth, and on real clips they produced six
backhands out of eight shots and smashes in the middle of baseline rallies.

Three of these shots are, however, *physically* defined, in the same way the serve
turned out to be. The serve detector proved the approach: instead of guessing from
position, state the physical fact that distinguishes the shot and test it directly.

  Smash  ball struck above the player's head, but NOT from a baseline.
         (Above the head is what serve and smash share; where you stand is what
         separates them, so this reuses the serve test with the zone inverted.)

  Volley ball struck with NO bounce between it and the previous contact, by a player
         in the forward half of their side. Volleying is *by definition* hitting
         before the bounce, so this is a fact about the event sequence rather than an
         inference from position. The position clause is a guard, not the signal:
         bounce recall is about 80 %, so a missed bounce would otherwise fake a volley
         at the baseline.

  Lob    outgoing flight whose apex is far above net height. Apex comes from the 3-D
         reconstruction, so this is only claimed for segments that passed the physical
         gates - an over-long segment inflates apex, which is precisely the artefact
         those gates reject.

Deliberately NOT included: the drop shot. It is defined by a low, short flight, and
that needs groundstroke speed, which is not yet validated against ground truth (only
serve speed is). Adding it now would be exactly the guess-dressed-as-measurement this
module exists to replace.

Every result carries the evidence that produced it, so a consumer can show why a shot
was called what it was - and so a wrong call is diagnosable instead of mysterious.
