───────────────────
Ball state machine.

Two independent classifications, for two different jobs:

1. FLOOR_LEVEL vs IN_FLIGHT  - for geometry (Phase 1's actual deliverable).
   Every trajectory reversal (a y-direction flip) is a floor-level event: either a
   player hit the ball or it bounced off the court. The floor homography is valid at
   *both*, so this split needs no further disambiguation - it only needs to separate
   "ball is at floor level, project it" from "ball is airborne, interpolate between
   anchors instead." See this module's classify_floor_level for why contact-vs-bounce is NOT required
   for this and why three tuning attempts at splitting them were abandoned.

2. CONTACT vs BOUNCE (secondary, best-effort) - for shot counting / stats, where a
   reversal caused by a player hitting the ball is meaningfully different from one
   caused by the court. This uses player-proximity as a heuristic and has a measured
   ceiling of ~5/7 correctly identified shots on the reference clip (see journal 0003)
   - it is useful but NOT a reliable ground truth. Do not tune it further hoping for a
   perfect split; the signal genuinely does not support it with position data alone.
   A better fix later is pose-based swing detection (Phase 2), not more thresholds here.

    Best-effort split of reversal frames into (contacts, bounces) by player proximity.

    Measured ceiling: ~5/7 real shots correctly identified on the reference clip

    cannot cleanly separate contact from bounce because of the frame offset between a
    detected reversal and the true contact instant, and because players are
    continuously near the ball throughout a rally. Use for approximate shot counting,
