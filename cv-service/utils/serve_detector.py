Identifies which contact frames are actually serves, from physical evidence.

What this replaces
------------------
`ShotClassifier._determine_shot_type` labelled a shot "Serve" purely because it was
first in the sequence:

    # First shot in sequence is always a serve
    if is_first_shot:
        return self.SHOT_TYPES['SERVE']

That premise only holds if a clip begins exactly at the start of a point. Ours are
cut from mid-match, so the first detected shot is usually a mid-rally groundstroke -
meaning every "Serve" the pipeline had ever reported was this heuristic firing rather
than a serve being recognised. Worse, `classify_shots` skips shot frames with missing
data, so when index 0 was skipped no shot got the flag at all and rallies came back
with no serve whatsoever (measured on six Wimbledon clips, all of which contain real
serves).

The evidence this uses instead
------------------------------
A serve is the only shot in tennis that is simultaneously:

  1. **Struck above the player's head.** The toss puts the ball well over the server -
     contact is around 2.7 m while the player is under 2 m. In image space the ball
     sits above the top edge of the player's bounding box. This alone also catches
     smashes, which share the trait.

  2. **Struck from the baseline or behind it.** This is what separates a serve from a
     smash: smashes are put away near the net, serves are struck from behind the
     baseline. Checked in mini-court space, where the two baselines are known
     geometry rather than image guesswork.

Both must hold. Each is independently measurable, and `explain=True` reports which
one rejected a frame so failures can be diagnosed rather than guessed at.

Deliberately NOT used: "is the first shot", ball direction, or rally position - those
are the assumptions that produced the phantom serves in the first place.

    Serves closer together than MIN_SERVE_SEPARATION_S are collapsed to one. A point
    cannot start twice inside a second: even a fault and second serve are separated by
    the time to retrieve a ball and reset. Measured on the eval suite, one clip reported
    serves 18 frames apart, 0.6s, which is physically impossible and was the ball being
    high above the player across a short window rather than two separate deliveries.

    When candidates cluster, the one with the ball highest above the hitter's head is
    kept. A serve's contact is the highest point of the toss, so the peak of a cluster is
    the delivery and its neighbours are the frames either side of it.

    `fps` matters because the separation is a duration, not a frame count: 18 frames is
    0.6s at 30fps and 0.3s at 60fps, and only one of those readings is about tennis.
