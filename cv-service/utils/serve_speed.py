────────────────────
Serve speed measured from floor-valid geometry only.

The problem this solves
-----------------------
Every other speed in this pipeline is derived from the ball's position after it has
been projected through the *floor* homography. That projection is only correct when
the ball is actually touching the floor. A tennis ball is airborne for roughly 90 %
of its flight, so its floor projection is the point where the camera ray through the
ball meets the ground - not where the ball is. Speeds computed from that projection
are wrong by an amount that depends on ball height and camera geometry, and measured
against broadcast radar on our own clips they came out roughly half the true value.

The fix, and why it is exact rather than another approximation
--------------------------------------------------------------
Two things in a serve ARE reliably on the floor:

  1. the server's feet at the moment of contact, and
  2. the ball's first bounce.

Both project through the floor homography correctly. The horizontal distance between
them is therefore a real measurement in metres, and dividing by the flight time gives
a real speed - no airborne projection involved anywhere.

Ignoring the ball's vertical drop costs almost nothing: a serve struck at ~2.7 m and
landing ~18 m away travels sqrt(18² + 2.7²) = 18.2 m, so treating the path as
horizontal understates it by ~1 %.

What this number is, precisely
------------------------------
It is the **average speed over the flight**, whereas a broadcast radar gun reports
the speed **at contact**. Air drag means the ball is always slower later in flight,
so this figure reads systematically below the televised one - expect roughly 10-15 %
for a flat serve. That is a known, explainable offset, not an error, and it must be
reported as "average flight speed" rather than dressed up as a radar-equivalent
number. `eval/serve_speed_accuracy.py` measures the real offset against broadcast
ground truth.

    Check the landing is where a legal serve must land: the service box opposite
    the server, between the net and that side's service line.

    Why this check is load-bearing rather than cosmetic
    ---------------------------------------------------
    The whole method rests on the bounce being a real floor contact, because only
    then is its floor projection meaningful. The hit/bounce classifier is ~84 %
    accurate, so roughly one in six "bounces" is not one - and when a mid-flight
    point is used instead, the ball is metres in the air and its floor projection
    lands far away. Measured on a Wimbledon clip: a serve contact projected to
    mini-court y = -16.7, i.e. *outside the court*, from a server standing at
    y = 552. That single bad point inflated the flight distance to 26.6 m when a
    serve travels ~18 m, which is the whole of the 31 % error against radar.

    A serve that lands anywhere else is not a serve landing, so the measurement is
    refused rather than reported.
