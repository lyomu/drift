utils/hit_bounce_classifier.py
───────────────────────────────
Classifies a floor-level ball event (from utils.ball_state.classify_floor_level) as a
CONTACT (player hit) or BOUNCE (court), using ball-trajectory shape alone - no player
position needed.

Why this exists
----------------
The player-proximity heuristic in classify_contact_vs_bounce has a measured ~5/7 ceiling
on our own footage that turned out to be mostly an artifact of an
incomplete ground truth, not the heuristic itself - but while
investigating that, feature exploration on the real 1,034-event TrackNet ground truth
(eval/explore_hit_bounce_features.py) found a much stronger, complementary signal:

  A bounce is a court reflection - mostly preserves horizontal (x) velocity, since the
  ground doesn't impart much sideways force. A hit is a player redirecting the ball, which
  can reverse or sharply change x-direction (cross-court shots, returns). Measured: hits
  flip x-direction 71.8% of the time, bounces only 2.1% of the time.

A 4-feature logistic regression (height, |vertical-velocity change|, |horizontal-velocity
change|, and whether x-direction flipped) trained on that data reaches 86.4% held-out
accuracy on a clip-level split (not event-level, which would leak camera/lighting/player
correlations) - see eval/train_hit_bounce_classifier.py for the full methodology and
eval/journal 0012 for the honest numbers.

That feature set was chosen on end-to-end shot F1, not on this accuracy. A six-feature
variant scores higher here (89.3%) and measurably worse in the pipeline (rally F1 0.600
against 0.824), because the extra features are raw signed velocities that are clean in
the hand-annotated training data and noisy in real TrackNet detections. The comment above
FEATURE_NAMES in the training script has the full table.

This is trajectory-only and needs no player detection, so it works even when player
tracking is unavailable, and combines naturally with the proximity heuristic where player
positions ARE available (main.py can use both and let them agree/disagree as a signal).

    some real contacts (verified on the reference clip) don't reverse vertical direction

    show a sharp change in horizontal velocity (the physical signal behind
    hit_bounce_classifier - journal 0012), even when the vertical trajectory barely moves.

    Tested standalone at dataset scale first (91 real clips): x-velocity alone actually
    recalls WORSE than y-reversal (70.3% vs 76.0% at the best threshold) - it is not a
    good replacement. But the UNION of both signals recalls 87.7%, a genuine +11.7 point

    Collapse candidates within min_gap frames of each other into one representative
    frame per cluster (the cluster's median).

    get_ball_shot_frames (y-reversal) and detect_xvelocity_candidates each fire near a
    real event independently, with no knowledge of each other, so their union can put
    several candidates a few frames apart around the same single real contact. On our
    own reference clip this inflated the apparent shot count from 7 (y-reversal only,
    journal 0012) to 22 (union, journal 0015) -- most of the "extra" shots turned out to
    be duplicate detections of the same handful of real events, not new false events
    (verified frame by frame). It also made downstream per-frame
    work (pose classification) sensitive to *which* nearby frame got checked: contact
    happens at one instant, so a candidate a few frames off has different wrist
    positions than the true contact frame, and pose can succeed on one cluster member
    while failing on another for the same swing.

    Clustering is bounded, not transitive
    -------------------------------------
    A candidate joins a cluster when it is within min_gap of the cluster's FIRST member,
    so no cluster is ever wider than min_gap frames.

    The original version compared against the cluster's LAST member, which chains: with
    min_gap=10, candidates at frames 0, 10, 20, 30, 40 all collapse into one cluster
    spanning 40 frames and report a single event at frame 20. In a dense rally that is
    not a corner case, it is the normal case, and it silently deleted real contacts.

    Measured across 12 dataset clips, 91 labelled contacts, changing only the linkage:

        linkage    recall   precision      F1
        chained     51.6%      94.0%    0.667
        bounded     68.1%      93.9%    0.790

    16.5 points of recall at no cost in precision, because the events being destroyed
    were real ones. The threshold itself needed no retuning: it was the linkage, not the
    value. Sweeping min_gap from 3 to 10 under bounded linkage moves precision from 75%
    to 94% while recall moves the other way, and 10 sits at the best F1 as well as the
    best precision, which is the trade this project wants.
