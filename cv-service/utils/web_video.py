──────────────────
Produces a browser-playable copy of the annotated video.

Why this is needed
------------------
The pipeline writes AVI with the MPEG-4 Part 2 codec, which OpenCV's VideoWriter
produces reliably across platforms. No browser can play it: Chrome, Firefox, Edge and
Safari support H.264/MP4, WebM and Ogg, and none of them support AVI. The 3-D viewer
referenced that file directly, so its "annotated video" tab showed nothing at all -
silently, because a <video> element with an unsupported source simply stays blank.

Transcoding to H.264 costs a few seconds and makes the whole output shareable: the
viewer, the video and the JSON can be zipped and opened by anyone.

`+faststart` moves the MP4 index to the front of the file so playback can begin before
the whole file is read, which matters when the page is opened over a network share or
served rather than opened locally.

    Transcode `source` to an H.264 MP4 beside it and return the new path.

    Args:

        cost the viewer its video tab, not the whole analysis run.
