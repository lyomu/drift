Constant-velocity Kalman filter for 2-D mini-court positions (player and ball).

Two jobs, both from the same filter:

1. Jitter reduction - a stationary or steadily-moving point stops visibly wobbling
   frame to frame (João's feedback: "denoise the projections to real world coordinates
   using something like a Kalman filter").

2. Instantaneous velocity - the filter's [vx, vy] state gives continuous ball/player
   speed without depending on correctly identifying discrete shot events. This turned
   out to matter more than expected: speed_accuracy.py was failing because the
   distance-between-two-shot-frames approach is only as good as shot-event detection
   (measured ceiling ~5/7 on our own footage). Kalman velocity sidesteps
   that entirely by estimating speed continuously from the whole trajectory.

Uses cv2.KalmanFilter (already a dependency via opencv-python) rather than adding
filterpy for one class's worth of functionality.

    detections and reported 371.7 km/h for a groundstroke. This isn't specific to that
    clip or to the candidate that triggered it: raw per-frame detection noise near an
    event frame can happen on any input, so `max_realistic_kmh` lets a caller reject the

# ── Fixed-interval (Rauch-Tung-Striebel) smoothing ───────────────────────────
#
# The filter above is causal: at frame k it has only seen frames up to k. That is the
# right constraint for live tracking and the wrong one here, because the whole video is
# on disk before analysis starts. A gap in detections is the clearest case - a forward
# filter entering one can only coast in a straight line at the last known velocity,
# while the frames AFTER the gap say exactly where the ball came out.
#
# The RTS smoother adds a backward pass that redistributes that future information into
# the past. It is the standard fixed-interval smoother for a linear Gaussian model and
# it is exact for one: no extra tuning, no new dependency, ~40 lines.
#
# Implemented directly rather than through cv2.KalmanFilter because the recursion needs
# the predicted covariance at each step (P_{k+1|k}), and driving OpenCV's filter while
# harvesting its internals is both fragile and harder to read than the equations.
#
# NOT enabled in the pipeline, because measurement says it does not earn its place yet.
# Against the TrackNet dataset's own labels (8 clips, 966 frames, via
# eval/ball_localization_accuracy.py --smooth):
#
#     configuration                coverage   recall@5px   median err
#     raw detections                  89.8%       36.9%        6.3px
#     RTS across the whole clip      100.0%       38.1%        6.7px
#     RTS per free-flight span       100.0%       38.4%        6.6px
#
# Two findings worth keeping.
#
# Smoothing ACROSS a contact is measurably worse than smoothing between contacts, at
# every setting tried. A racket hit or bounce changes the velocity discontinuously, so a
# constant-velocity smoother run through one blends the incoming and outgoing velocities
# and pulls the estimate off the truth on both sides. Within the sweep, the least
# aggressive setting always won, which is the same fact seen from another angle.
#
# But even applied per span it does not improve median error, and the reason is that
# TrackNet's error is not Gaussian: median 5.8px against a 90th percentile of 19.4px is a
# heavy tail of gross mislocalizations, usually the detector locking onto the wrong
# object. A Kalman smoother assumes zero-mean Gaussian noise, so it spreads those
# outliers into neighbouring good frames rather than rejecting them. The missing step is
# an outlier gate before smoothing (a chi-square test on the innovation against the
# predicted covariance), which would drop those measurements instead of averaging them in.
# Until that exists, smoothing buys complete coverage and about 1.5 points of recall for
# 4% worse median error, which is not a trade worth making by default.
