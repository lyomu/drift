─────────────────────
Relabels a rally's events using the sequence rules of tennis, not just the classifier.

The problem this solves
-----------------------
The hit/bounce classifier looks at one event at a time and measures 86.4% held out, so
roughly one event in seven is wrong. Independently that is a respectable number. In a
sequence it is not, because the errors produce rallies that cannot physically happen: the
rally self-audit reports one player hitting five times in succession on the reference
clip, which no shot selection or rule of tennis produces.

Flagging that is useful. Fixing it is better, and the information needed is already
present: a rally is a grammar. Some orderings are legal, some are impossible, and the
classifier emits a probability rather than a hard label. Choosing the most likely
labelling that obeys the grammar is a decoding problem, solved exactly by Viterbi over a
small state space. It is the same technique that lets a language model repair character
errors in OCR, applied to a sport instead of a sentence.

The grammar
-----------
State is (last label, which side last struck the ball).

    contact(near) -> contact(near)   IMPOSSIBLE, the ball never crossed the net
    contact(far)  -> contact(far)    IMPOSSIBLE, likewise
    contact(X)    -> contact(Y)      legal, a volley taken before the bounce
    contact(X)    -> bounce          legal, the normal case
    bounce        -> contact(X)      legal, a groundstroke
    bounce        -> bounce          IMPOSSIBLE mid-rally, a second bounce ends the point

Which side a contact came from is data, not a choice: it is read from where the event
happened. Only the contact-or-bounce label is decided here.

Relabelling alone is not enough, and the labels say so
------------------------------------------------------
The first version of this decoder could only repair an impossible ordering by FLIPPING a
label. Measured against the labelled reference clip it made things worse: false positives
went from 7 to 10 with no recall gain. The reason is structural rather than a tuning
problem. Both rules resolve a conflict by relabelling, so every repair pushes an event
into the other class, and on a candidate set where half the candidates are not real events
at all (recall 100%, precision 41%) those repairs land on noise.

So the grammar needs a third option: a candidate can be spurious. A candidate labelled
NOISE leaves the rally state untouched, which lets the decoder resolve an impossible
ordering by DISCARDING a candidate instead of promoting it. That is usually the correct
repair, because the thing that made the ordering impossible is normally a candidate that
was never an event.

Discarding is not free: it costs recall, monotonically, and the labelled data shows it. So
`deletion_prior` is set to the smallest value that gets the full coherence benefit rather
than the one that scores best on coherence. At 0.0 the NOISE state is off and this is pure
relabelling.

What this cannot do
-------------------
It cannot invent an event that was never detected, and it does not try: a missing contact
stays missing, and the rally audit still reports it.

It is also honest about cost. Every flip is recorded with the probability it overruled,
so a run that had to fight the classifier hard is visible rather than silent. If the
decoder is flipping many high-confidence events, the classifier or the candidate
generator is wrong in a way that a grammar should not be papering over.

#
# Most of the benefit is relabelling, not deletion. On a 4-clip subset where all of this
# was re-checked, relabelling alone removes 45% of the impossible events while keeping
# every candidate; the first slice of deletion adds another 5 points and costs 9% of them.
#
# Above 0.02 coherence improves only slightly and not monotonically (35, 31, 34, 30) while
# events kept and recall both fall steadily. Going from 0.02 to 0.15 buys a 14% better
# coherence number for 2.6 points of recall and 12 more discarded events, which is the
# wrong way round: a missing contact is worse than an incoherent one, because the audit can
# see incoherence and cannot see absence.
#
# The reference clip alone suggested a plateau up to 0.20 and that is how 0.15 got shipped
# first. That clip saturates early, so its flatness was an artefact; the 40-clip recall
# curve is what showed the cost was real.
