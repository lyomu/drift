eval/train_forehand_backhand.py
───────────────────────────────
Trains and honestly evaluates a forehand/backhand classifier on THETIS pose features.

The baseline it has to beat
---------------------------
The hand-crafted geometry in utils/pose_shot_classifier.py scores 54% on this task,
predicting forehand 89% of the time. On a balanced two-class problem that is barely above
chance, and it is not fixable by tuning: even given the correct hitting hand it tops out
at 78%, and on volleys it reaches 27% because a volley is played with the body square to
the net and the wrist never crosses the shoulder midline the rule depends on.

Anything below about 60% here is not worth shipping over the rule it replaces.

Why the split is by subject
---------------------------
THETIS has 55 subjects, each performing every stroke several times. A random split puts
the same persons other takes on both sides and measures memorisation of that person rather
than knowledge of the stroke. Grouping by subject is the difference between a number that
transfers and a number that flatters.

Repeated splits, not one
------------------------
A single split over 55 subjects is noisy enough to pick a winner by luck. Every
configuration is scored over many subject-grouped splits and reported with its spread, so
a difference smaller than the spread is correctly read as no difference.

Class balance
-------------
The source classes are balanced, but the USABLE set is not: pose extraction fails more
often on backhands, because the body turns away from the camera. Training on that as-is
would bake in the very bias this classifier exists to remove, so classes are reweighted to
equal influence and both balanced accuracy and per-class recall are reported. Overall
accuracy alone would let a forehand-always model look respectable.
