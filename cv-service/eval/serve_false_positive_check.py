Does the pipeline claim a serve on clips that contain none?

Why this matters more than it sounds
------------------------------------
Most footage a user brings is cut from mid-rally. It contains no serve at all, and a
system that labels the first shot it sees "Serve" is wrong on nearly every such clip
while looking confident. That was the original behaviour here:

    # First shot in sequence is always a serve
    if is_first_shot:
        return self.SHOT_TYPES['SERVE']

It was replaced by utils/serve_detector.py, which requires two independent physical
facts: the ball struck above the player's head, and the hitter at or behind a baseline.
This script checks that the replacement actually holds on real clips, because the failure
it guards against is silent.

What the numbers mean
---------------------
A serve claimed on a mid-rally clip is a false positive and is the failure under test.
A serve claimed on a clip that opens with one is correct. The script reports per-clip
counts and the reason each candidate was rejected, so a wrong call is diagnosable rather
than mysterious.

This does NOT prove serve detection is accurate. It only shows how often serves are
claimed, and where. Confirming each claim is right needs hand-labelled shot types, which
tools/label_shots.py produces and this repository does not yet have at scale.
