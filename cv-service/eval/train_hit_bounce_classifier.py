eval/train_hit_bounce_classifier.py
─────────────────────────────────────
Trains and honestly evaluates a hit-vs-bounce classifier on the real 1,034-event feature
set from explore_hit_bounce_features.py.

Ladder-thinking, in order:
  1. Single strongest feature (|vx change|) with a plain threshold - 80.4% held-out.
     (height_y alone: 55.1% - barely above the class baseline, confirms the earlier
     coarse mean/std comparison was too optimistic about height on its own.)
  2. 3-feature logistic regression (height_y, vy_change_mag, vx_change_mag) - 84.1%
     held-out, train/test nearly identical (84.0%/84.1%, so not overfitting). The
     ~3.7-point gain over the single feature earns the extra (still small, interpretable)
     complexity. Stopping here - more features would need justifying against this bar too.

Split by CLIP, not by event, throughout: events from the same clip share camera,
lighting, and players, so an event-level split would leak information and overstate
accuracy.

Saves the trained logistic-regression weights to models/hit_bounce_classifier.json for
utils/hit_bounce_classifier.py to load - kept as data, not hardcoded, so retraining on
more data later doesn't need a code change.

# The three original features plus vx_sign_flip, the strongest single measured signal:
# 71.8% of hits reverse x-direction against 2.1% of bounces. It was measured during the
# original feature exploration and then left out of the model.
#
# This is NOT the most accurate feature set on this dataset, and that is deliberate.
# Measured two ways - dataset accuracy on a clip-grouped split, and end-to-end shot F1
# on the reference rally:
#
#     features                          held-out acc    rally F1
#     height, |vy|, |vx|          (3)       84.1%         0.737
#     + vy_before, vy_after       (6)       89.3%         0.600

#
# The six-feature model is the best on paper and the worst in the product. The cause is
# a train/serve mismatch: this dataset's velocities come from hand-annotated ball
# positions, while the pipeline computes them from TrackNet detections with interpolated
# gaps. Raw signed velocities are the most noise-sensitive features of the set, they took
# the largest weights, and that accuracy did not survive contact with real detections.
# vx_sign_flip is a coarse binary, so it degrades gracefully instead.
#
# Optimise the end-to-end number, not this one. Caveat on the rally column: one clip,
# 7 labelled shots, so treat it as directional rather than precise.
