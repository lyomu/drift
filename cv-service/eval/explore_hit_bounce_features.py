────────────────────────────────────
Feature exploration for hit-vs-bounce classification, using the real 1,030-event
TrackNet ground truth.

Physical hypotheses to test before committing to any model (ladder-thinking - check
what actually separates the classes before reaching for anything more than the simplest
feature that works):

  1. Height (already measured: hit mean 275px, bounce mean 315px - real but overlapping).
  2. Vertical velocity magnitude change at the event (both cause a y-reversal by
     definition, so this may not discriminate much - testing anyway).
  3. Horizontal (x) velocity change - a bounce is a court reflection, which mostly
     preserves x-velocity (no strong sideways force from the ground). A hit is a player
     redirecting the ball - can reverse or sharply change x-direction (cross-court shots,
     returns). If this holds, it should be a much stronger signal than height alone.

Split by CLIP, not by event - events from the same clip share camera, lighting, and
players, so an event-level split would leak information and overstate accuracy.
