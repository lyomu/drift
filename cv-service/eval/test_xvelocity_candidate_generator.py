eval/test_xvelocity_candidate_generator.py
────────────────────────────────────────────
Tests whether an x-velocity-change-based candidate generator recovers real contacts that
the existing y-reversal detector structurally misses (journal 0014: some real shots don't
reverse vertical direction at all, or reverse too shallowly - not a threshold problem,
verified by sweeping min_delta_y down to 1 with no change).

Motivation: journal 0012 established that |vx change| is what physically distinguishes a
hit (player redirects the ball, can reverse x-direction) from a bounce or from noise
(court/trajectory mostly preserves x-velocity). If that's true, an x-velocity-change local
maximum should be a candidate-generation signal in its own right, not just a downstream
classifier feature - and might catch real contacts a pure y-reversal misses.

Tested at dataset scale (91 real clips), not just our own clip - the count-match mistake
from journal 0014 was exactly a result of not doing this the first time.
