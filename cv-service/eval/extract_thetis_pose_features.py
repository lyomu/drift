────────────────────────────────────
Extracts named pose features from THETIS clips for forehand/backhand training.

Why a learned classifier replaces the geometric rule
----------------------------------------------------
The hand-crafted side projection in utils/pose_shot_classifier.py measures 54% against
THETIS ground truth on a balanced two-class problem, predicting forehand 89% of the time
(eval/forehand_backhand_on_thetis.py). Its ceiling is structural, not a tuning issue: even
given the correct hitting hand it tops out at 78%, and on volleys it reaches 27%, because
a volley is blocked with the body square to the net and the wrist never crosses the
shoulder midline the whole test depends on.

No rule covers both cases without becoming a classifier, so this builds the input for one.

Why named summary features rather than raw sequences
----------------------------------------------------
The first version of this script emitted a 16-frame sequence as 384 raw numbers. With the
data available that was more than twice as many features as samples, which fits noise and
produces an accuracy that means nothing.

These are ~20 named quantities instead, each one a thing a coach would actually point at:
how fast each wrist travelled, which side of the body it was on at the moment of peak
speed, how far apart the hands were, how much the shoulders rotated. That keeps the model
small enough to train honestly, and it keeps the learned weights readable, so a wrong
prediction can be traced to a feature rather than to a black box. It is the same approach
as utils/hit_bounce_classifier, which uses four named features and is interpretable for
exactly this reason.

Everything is measured in a body-relative frame
-----------------------------------------------
Positions are relative to the torso centre and divided by shoulder width, so features do
not change with where the player stands, how far away they are, or the video resolution.
Speeds are in shoulder-widths per frame for the same reason.

The moment that matters is peak wrist speed, which is the closest available proxy for
contact in a clip that carries no ball annotation.

Splitting
---------
THETIS subject ids are p1 to p55 (p1-p31 beginners, p32-p55 experts) and each subject
performs every stroke several times. Splitting by clip would put the same persons other
takes in both train and test and overstate accuracy badly, so the subject is recorded on
every sample and training must group on it.
