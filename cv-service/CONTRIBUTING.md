# Contributing to Tennis-Vision

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Tennis-Vision! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- Basic understanding of computer vision and machine learning
- Familiarity with PyTorch and OpenCV

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   # Fork on GitHub, then clone your fork
   git clone https://github.com/HarshTomar1234/Tennis-Vision.git
   cd Tennis-Vision
   ```

2. **Set up development environment**
   ```bash
   # Create virtual environment
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # Install the project and its development extras
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   pip install pre-commit
   ```

3. **Set up pre-commit hooks**
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

   The hooks lint for genuine errors only (syntax, undefined names, redefinitions)
   and do not reformat. This codebase predates any formatter, so turning one on now
   would bury real changes under thousands of reformatting lines. There is no `black`
   or `flake8` step; `.pre-commit-config.yaml` uses `ruff` at the same scope CI does,
   so a green pre-commit means a green CI.

4. **Run the tests**
   ```bash
   pytest tests/                  # everything, needs the model weights
   pytest tests/ -m "not slow"    # what CI runs; no weights needed
   ```

   The `slow` marker covers the end-to-end smoke test, which runs the real pipeline
   and needs the downloadable weights. Without them it skips with the command that
   fetches them rather than failing.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

Before creating an issue, please:
- Check existing issues to avoid duplicates
- Use the issue templates when available
- Provide clear, detailed descriptions
- Include system information and error logs

### Submitting Pull Requests

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Follow the code style guidelines below
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   # Run tests
   pytest tests/
   
   # Check code style
   black --check .
   flake8 .
   ```

4. **Commit and push**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. **Create Pull Request**
   - Use descriptive titles and descriptions
   - Reference related issues
   - Include screenshots/videos for visual changes

## Code Style Guidelines

### Python Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 standards
- Use Black for code formatting
- Maximum line length: 88 characters
- Use type hints where appropriate

```python
# Good
def detect_players(frame: np.ndarray, confidence: float = 0.7) -> List[Dict]:
    """Detect players in the given frame."""
    pass

# Bad
def detect_players(frame, confidence=0.7):
    pass
```

### Documentation

- Use docstrings for all functions and classes
- Follow Google-style docstrings
- Include parameter types and return types
- Add usage examples for complex functions

```python
def track_ball(frames: List[np.ndarray], model_path: str) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    """Track ball positions across multiple frames.
    
    Args:
        frames: List of video frames as numpy arrays
        model_path: Path to the trained ball detection model
        
    Returns:
        List of (x, y) coordinates for ball positions
        
    Example:
        >>> frames = load_video_frames("match.mp4")
        >>> positions = track_ball(frames, "models/ball_model.pt")
        >>> print(f"Ball detected at {len(positions)} positions")
    """
    pass
```

### Commit Message Format

Use conventional commits format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat(tracker): add ball trajectory smoothing
fix(detection): resolve false positive filtering
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

- Mock external dependencies

```python
def test_ball_detection_with_valid_frame():
    """Test ball detection with a valid input frame."""
    frame = create_test_frame_with_ball()
    detections = detect_ball(frame)
    assert len(detections) == 1
    assert detections[0]['confidence'] > 0.5
```
